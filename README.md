# 🌱 AI Plant Disease Identifier

This project addresses the critical problem of crop losses due to plant diseases. By leveraging cutting-edge AI and computer vision, we built a model that can **identify plant diseases from leaf images with impressive speed and accuracy**, empowering farmers with early diagnosis and actionable insights.
